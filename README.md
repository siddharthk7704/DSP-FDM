Digital Signal Processing and Machine Learning in Voice Analysis

In the following project, a voice signal was analyzed based on some DSP and ML algorithms to judge the performance comparison of different classification models. At the first step, the voice signal is recorded in .wav format, followed by adding artificial noise and phase distortion to generate signals simulating real-case scenarios. The distorted voice signal was decomposed using Fourier decomposition to extract the features. The extracted features were used as inputs in various machine learning classifiers, which included LSTM RNN, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The performance of the models was checked and compared in terms of the accuracy of the classification of the distorted voice features. Cross-validation was employed to ensure the robustness of the models. This study provided insight into how machine learning techniques can be applied to voice signal processing.
